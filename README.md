## ABSTRACT
Over the centuries, our personal experiences and the evolution of linguistics made us able to connect even the most distant topics, and we are now reflecting this tendency in knowledge graphs like Wikipedia.
However, among the countless paths connecting two topics, our fallible mind often relies on our biased knowledge to create those connections: this leads us to trace paths that can appear obvious to us, but unnecessarily long or even nonsensical to a machine, which is traditionally seeking the fastest and optimal approach.
The Man and the Machine starts from human navigation paths, defined by the users playing Wikispeedia, to then dwell into machine-based paths based on semantic distances between the different topics. To do so, we will embed wikipedia pages into vector, use the respective semantic distances to implement the A* search algorithm and ultimately compare Men and Machines path structures.
